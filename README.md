# Contactform Recorder plugin for Craft CMS

Plugin for Craft CMS to backup messages sent through P&amp;T&#39;s Contact Form plugin into the database.
There is (at the moment) no way to display those records in the CP. The plugin just provides a backup in case emails get lost e.g. if they can't be delivered for one reason or the other.
